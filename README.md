# HyperBloch

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10783024.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10783024)

HyperBloch is a Mathematica package for constructing tight-binding models on
hyperbolic lattices and calculating their band structures using the supercell
method. It is based on
> P. M. Lenggenhager, J. Maciejko, and T. Bzdušek,
  *Non-Abelian hyperbolic band theory from supercells*,
  [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 226401](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.226401) (2023)
  
and the doctoral thesis

  *Emerging avenues in band theory: multigap topology and hyperbolic lattices*,
  [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000645370), ETH Zurich (2023)

A getting-started guide for this and its sister package
([HyperCells](https://github.com/patrick-lenggenhager/HyperCells)) can be found
[here](https://patrick-lenggenhager.github.io/software/2024/01/10/HyperGuide.html) and
[this post](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3131734) in the Wolfram
Community forum demonstrates some of the core functionality of the package.

## Authors and developers

Main developer:\
&ensp;&ensp;**Patrick M. Lenggenhager**\
&ensp;&ensp;Email: plengg@pks.mpg.de\
&ensp;&ensp;Website: https://patrick-lenggenhager.github.io

Coauthors:\
&ensp;&ensp;**Joseph Maciejko** (maciejko@ualberta.ca)\

## Installation

### Dependencies

HyperBloch requires the `NCAlgebra` package, which is available from GitHub at
[https://github.com/NCAlgebra/NC](https://github.com/NCAlgebra/NC)
Please check the installation instructions there.

### HyperBloch

In the future, HyperBloch will be submitted to the
[Wolfram Language Paclet Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/).
Until then, it can be installed manually. For version 0.9.0, the following command
can be used:
```Mathematica
PacletInstall["https://github.com/patrick-lenggenhager/HyperBloch/releases/download/v0.9.0/PatrickMLenggenhager__HyperBloch-0.9.0.paclet"]
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release (as a `.paclet` file) from
https://github.com/patrick-lenggenhager/HyperBloch/releases/latest,
open Mathematica and evaluate
```Mathematica
PacletInstall["path/to/PatrickMLenggenhager__HyperBloch-x.x.x.paclet"]
```
where `path/to/PatrickMLenggenhager__HyperBloch-x.x.x.paclet` is the path to the
downloaded `.paclet` file.

Then, load the package by evaluating
```Mathematica
<< PatrickMLenggenhager`HyperBloch`
```

Note that while most of the functionality of HyperBloch is available with Wolfram
Language 12.0, some of the visualization functions require Wolfram Language 13 or
later, such that updating to Wolfram Language 13 is recommended.

## Documentation

The documentation is distributed as part of the paclet and integrates into the
Wolfram Language documentation center. To access it, open Mathematica and press
`F1` or click on the `Help` menu and select `Wolfram Documentation`. Then, search
for "HyperBloch" in the search bar.
A good place to start is the Tech Note "Basic Usage", which is usually among the
first few results. Alternatively, you can access the documentation pages directly:
`PatrickMLenggenhager/HyperBloch/tutorial/BasicUsage`.

The Guide page (`PatrickMLenggenhager/HyperBloch/guide/HyperBlochPackage`) contains
an overview over the package and its functionality. The reference pages
contain detailed information about the package's functions and options.


## Limitations
Note that at this point *HyperBloch* is still under development and, because the
limitations have not yet been fully determined, released only as a beta version.
Further testing will be required before an official release. However, the package
is already fully functional and documented and can be used to reproduce the results
of the publication mentioned above.

In newer versions of Mathematica, the visualization functions may lead to warnings
about badly conditioned warnings. These warnings can, in most cases, be safely
ignored. For very large cells, the visualization of objects close to the boundary of
the Poincaré disk may be inaccurate. However, the deviations will most likely not
be visible. If you do encounter visible inaccuracies, please report them using the
issue tracker at
> https://github.com/patrick-lenggenhager/HyperBloch/issues

## HyperCells package

The HyperCells [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package is a companion package to
HyperBloch. The input HyperBloch requires, i.e., the graphs representing primitive
and supercells of hyperbolic lattices and models defined on them, can be generated
using HyperCells. It is available on Github at
> https://github.com/patrick-lenggenhager/HyperCells
